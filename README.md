Development of a Point of Sale for a coffee shop business.


The aim of this project has been to develop a type of software application known
as Point of Purchase or Point of Sale. It is meant to facilitate the work in the
establishment and keep the record of the sales and stocks.
This project focuses on a POP for a business that serves food and drinks like a cafe
or a bar. The main function allows the waiter to track customer consumption and
print the bill. Additional modules for managers include inventory management,
employees administration and sales statistics.
Although this is only a prototype, it can be projected as the first approach to a full
POS application that could be extended with functionalities such as communications
between terminals that can get orders from tables, cloud storage or promotions.
